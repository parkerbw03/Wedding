    <h3>Allison McGregor</h3>
    <h4>Matron of Honor/Bride’s childhood friend</h4>
    <div style="overflow: hidden;">
    <p>Allison and I have been best friends since she was born 30 days after me. We have been through so much together: from playing barbies in church to going on mission trips to sleepovers that turned into all-nighters to crying with each other during the rough high school years. Allison loves God, cats and chocolate and I can’t imagine my wedding day without her next to me!<br> - Kathryn</p>

    <h3>Laura Bynum</h3>
    <h4>Bridesmaid/Bride's “little” sister</h4>
    <div style="overflow: hidden;">
    <p>Laura and I have been forced friends since she was born in 1999. Because I got a sister, we were then able to team up on our brother, but only for a short while. She keeps me laughing with her quick wittiness and her smile and I’m really going to miss seeing that everyday. She’s beautiful inside and out and loves to hang out with her friends. I can’t imagine my wedding day without my little sissy up there with me. - Kathryn</p>

    <h3>Natalie Smith</h3>
    <h4>Bridesmaid/Groom's sister</h4>
    <div style="overflow: hidden;">
    <p>Natalie and I have been friends for a long time. We met when her family started coming to my church and I instantly looked up to her as an older sister. She helped me through rough times while I was growing up and was my camp counselor at church camp 5th and 6th grade. She really loves God and her family and I can’t imagine my wedding day without my future sister with me. - Kathryn</p>

    <h3>Taylor Batte</h3>
    <h4>Bridesmaid/Bride’s friend from high school</h4>
    <div style="overflow: hidden;">
    <p>Taylor Batte and I have been friends since junior year of high school. Thanks to Taylor and Allison for introducing us because we’re like sisters. She loves to travel and spread the love of God to everyone she meets and that is why she’s going to be such a fantastic missionary to England come August. I’m glad that it worked out that Ben and my wedding is before she leaves because I can’t imagine my day without her. - Kathryn</p>

    <h3>Taylor Johnson</h3>
    <h4>Bridesmaid/Bride’s childhood friend</h4>
    <div style="overflow: hidden;">
    <p>Taylor and I have been best friends since she moved to Tennessee in 2000. Taylor and I played soccer together for several years, and we played Upward Basketball (although we were on separate teams and I never wanted to guard her cause she was so good). I love how she loves to sing praise to our God. My wedding day wouldn’t be complete if she wasn’t there. - Kathryn</p>

    <h3>Sara Billingsley</h3>
    <h4>Bridesmaid/Bride's cousin</h4>
    <div style="overflow: hidden;">
    <p>Sara and I have been friends since her birth. I guess God knew that if we were sisters we’d have too much fun for either parents to handle so he had to separate us. Even though we don’t get to see each other as often as we would like, we pick up right where we left off and quickly catch up. Sara loves to spend her semesters and summers spreading God’s word and love to everyone. I’m thankful that she said yes to being a bridesmaid because I really wanted her to be with me on my wedding day. - Kathryn</p>
