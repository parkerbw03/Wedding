    <h3>John Elrod</h3>
    <h4>Best Man</h4>
    <div style="overflow: hidden;">
        <p>Johnny Boy is my best friend. We've been good friends ever since I started taking piano lessons from his mom, Linda. After my piano lesson ended, we would either go outside and play one-on-one basketball, or stay in and play Star Wars: Battlefront 2. Either way, I dominated (he'd tell you differently. He might even tell you other ridiculous things like he's taller than me.). We've been through a lot together over the years, and I'm so unbelievably honored to have John as my friend and Best Man. - Ben</p>

    <h3>Jed Parker</h3>
    <h4>Groomsman/Groom's Brother</h4>
    <div style="overflow: hidden;">
    <p>Jed is my little bro, and he's one of my best buds. There's a 9 year age difference between us, but despite that, we share a lot of interests, like our love of music, video games, cereal, and Star Wars. Jed is already an avid photographer, a very talented pianist, and he's becoming a leader in his church youth group. I love him to death, and I'm very proud of the young man he's grown up to be. - Ben </p>

    <h3>David Bynum</h3>
    <h4>Groomsman/Bride's brother</h4>
    <div style="overflow: hidden;">
    <p>David is Kathryn's little bro, and he's a good friend of mine. David is currently in college at Tennessee Tech University and is studying chemical engineering, so he's already smarter than I am. He also kicks my behind in ping pong just about every time we play. Regardless, David is a really great guy, and I'm really excited and honored that he agreed to be one of my groomsmen. - Ben </p>

    <h3>Aubrey Woodfin</h3>
    <h4>Groomsman/Groom's friend from college</h4>
    <div style="overflow: hidden;">
    <p>Aubrey has been one of my best buds since freshman year at Lipscomb. We had a bunch of classes together and lived a few doors down from each other, and we eventually ended up being roommates our senior year. Now, every once in a while, he'll drive up from where he lives in South Pittsburg, TN, and stay for the weekend regardless of giving us any advanced notice of his arrival (He's getting better about that.). Aubrey is a really good dude and a great friend. - Ben  </p>

    <h3>David Pyle</h3>
    <h4>Groomsman/Groom's friend from college</h4>
    <div style="overflow: hidden;">
    <p>David Pyle, AKA DW, AKA Gomer Pyle has been a good friend since freshman year of Lipscomb. We had the same major so we had lots of classes together, and hung out quite a bit at school. After school, we ended up getting a job at the same company and worked there for nearly 2 years before both of us moved on within a week of each other. We still hang out quite a bit. We like to kayak, watch football, go to the movies, and eat at Panda Express. I'm really excited that David will be up there with me on my wedding day. - Ben</p>

    <h3>Tyler Kendrick</h3>
    <h4>Groomsman/Groom's friend from college</h4>
    <div style="overflow: hidden;">
    <p>Tyler and I have been roommates two seperate times for a total of over 3 years now. We got put in the same dormroom as freshmen at Lipscomb by random draw, and we've been friends ever since we told our mothers that we didn't need any drapes in our dormroom. After we finished school, I got a job in Nashville and we decided to live in an apartment and be roommates for the second time. My getting married is going to break our long running roommate streak, but he's getting married this year too so I have a feeling we'll be just fine. - Ben  </p>
